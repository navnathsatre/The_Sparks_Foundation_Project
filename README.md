# The Sparks Foundation Tasks


All tasks performed by me in GRIP : Data Science And Business Analytics Internship in [The Sparks Foundation](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)
- **Internship Category** - Data Science and Business Analytics
- **Internship Duration** - 1 Month ( June-2021 )
- **Internship Type** - Work from Home

In this internship, I have Completed all given tasks within the given time-frame.

## Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML 
1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. Data can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data
4. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

## Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
2. Use Python for perform this task.
3. Data can be found at : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

## Task-3 : To Explore Business Analytics - Retail
1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
2. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
3. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
4. Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

## Task-4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
2. As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
3. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
4. Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

## Task-5 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’
2. As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.
3. Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.
4. Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b

## Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
